        I started my journey as a Commerce student. Didnâ€™t know what profession
        I should choose. But one thing that worked well for me is that I got
        enough opportunities to learn and explore new things. Out of curiosity,
        in my college days, I started designing websites on Wix. Then got
        introduced to UI/UX design. Made some interesting designs, wireframes,
        and prototypes. But one thing that led me to code is what's the meaning
        of my designs if I can't create them in real. It's like giving life to
        something. And today, here I'm giving my designs a life.
